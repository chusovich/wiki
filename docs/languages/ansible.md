# Ansible

# Configuration Files
- Environment Variables
- Config file in the working directory
- default directory
# Inventory
You need ssh access
located in /etc/ansible/hosts
inventory parameters:
- ansible_host: aliase for server IP/FQDN
- ansible_connection: ssh or winrm 
- ansible_port: 
- ansible_user: user ansible uses
- ansible_ssh-pass:
# Inventory Formats
- .ini: simplest and most straightfoward
- .yaml: more structed and flexible
# Grouping and Parent Child Relationships
use labels to target a group of a servers at the same time
# Variables
store information that vary with each host
can be included in the playbook or in a separate file
# Variable Precedence
host variables take precednce over group variables
but playbook overrides host and group
but if you pass in a var through the command line, that takes presesndnce over the play book vars
# Variable Scoping
host scope
play scope
global
# Magic Variables
- hostvars: variables form other hosts
- groups: returns all hosts of the that groups
- group_names: returns all groups for a host
- inventory_hostname: returns name configured for host in the inventory files
# Facts
Facts are bits of information collected from the server once ansible connects to it
Uses setup module (run automatically)
Facts are stored in variable "ansible_facts"
Can disable facts by used gather_facts: no
Can also be setup in the ansible configuration file (gathering = implicit)
Facts only gathered for hosts part of the playbook
# Playbooks
A single yaml containing a set of plays
a play defines a set of task to run on a host/set of hosts
an action to perform on the host
the yaml format
playbook is an list (or array) of dictionaries
each dictionary has a hosts, name and tasks key
The tasks is a list of dictionaries
## Modules
action run by a task ("command" is the module in the example below)
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Execute command 'data'
	command: date
```
## Running playbooks
```
ansible-playbook <playbook file name>
```
# Verifying Playbooks
## Check Mode
dry run where no actual changes to the hosts
use --check option when running the playbook
## Diff Mode
Shows a before and after 
user the --diff option
## Syntax Check
use --syntax-check option
# Ansible Lint
command line style checker
```
ansible-lint playbook.yml
```
# Conditionals
run certain tasks based on conditions
also can be used in loops
# Conditionals based on facts, etc.
# Loops
## Loop
## With_*
# Modules
## Groups
- system: system level stuff: firewalls, etc
- commands: commands and scripts
- Files: 
- Database
- Cloud: different cloud provider helpers
- Windows: 
## Exmamples
### command
```yaml # basic command task
tasks:
  - name: execute 'date' commmand
    command: date
```
```yaml
tasks: # these tasks do the same thing, but the second use parameters
  - name: Display resolv.conf contents
	command: cat /etc/resolv.conf

  - name: Dipslay resolv.conf contents
    command: cat resolv.conf chdir=/etc
```
free form parameter:
### script
executes a local script on a remove node after transferring it
### service
start vs started - idempotency (a command can be run multiple times without modified )
started = ensure the service is started
### lineinfile
serach for a line and replace or add it to a file
it is idempotent
# Plugins
help with cloud stuff
# Modules and Plugins Index
# Handlers
- tasks triggered by events/notifications
- defined in playbook , executed when notified by a task
# Roles
assigning a role means doing everything the server needs to do to accomplish it's purpose
it is a set of tasks, and it basically as playbook, that is typically set as constant and can be easily reused
# Collections
collections of plugins, collections, 
# Templating
