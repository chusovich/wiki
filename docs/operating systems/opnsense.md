# OpnSense

## Installing on Proxmox
### Download .iso
[OPNsense® Download page](https://opnsense.org/download/)

select architecture, image type (dvd is typical), and location (LeaseWeb East Coast)

### Proxmox Setup
> [!note]
> You don't need to configure any network settomgs yet. You can add software VLANs or PCI pass-through NICs in the later. By default, 
OPNsense will be assigned an IP address on the network that Proxmox is on.

Import the .iso into Proxmox and and create a VM with the following settings:
- 2 GB of ram
- 2 cores (?)
- 12 GB of disk space

Everything else should be able to be kept at default.

### Create our LAN
The network that proxmox is on will be the WAN from the perspective or OPNsense. We can't access OPNsense from it's WAN, so we need to add a machine to it's LAN so we can get to the web UI. First, we need to create the LAN.

#### Creating a software VLAN
In Proxmox, create a new interface and make it a VLAN
Add this VLAN to the OPNsense VM
Then add an Ubuntu Desktop VM and make it's network adapter the VLAN.
You may want to add a PiHole VM to this VLAN to be the router. 

#### Adding an addition network interface
you can also give OPNsense access to a physical LAN with an additional NIC with PCIe passthrough
